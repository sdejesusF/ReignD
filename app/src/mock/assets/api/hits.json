On mobile phones based on Symbian, BlackBerry 10, Android proxy is configured per network connection (i.e. single Wi-Fi AP) and it is system-wide configuration, which has been working flawlessly under all aforementioned platforms.<p>As developer, I&#x27;d like to thank you for discovery of PAC proxy, because it has helped me many times to mimic or redirect network traffic, i.e when I needed to connect my phone with laptop using DNS names in the same local network. It is worth noting PAC proxy is superb to investigate or block traffic to servers where are collected usage metrics &#x2F; telemetry on android phones by setting redirect to your own server.<p>I would be grateful if you could answer on following question: How do you debug&#x2F;test PAC proxy if given pattern works or not? Because I am using the method known by most of PHP developers - develop, refresh (reconnect) and check manually by sending request once again if new entry works or not.",

I like react-native and have used it, but a &lt;Text&gt;, &lt;View&gt;, or &lt;ScrollView&gt; isn't the same thing as directly using the native widget APIs yourself, or using the native tooling like <em>Android</em> XML files, XIBs, etc. There's a class of apps where you really need the direct access, and currently for React-Native, that means writing native modules and tying them to markup, which invariably leads to people trying to create versions that work on <em>Android</em> and iOS unified by a single &lt;Element&gt;.<p>React-Native works, apps like Discord prove that. But Gmail and Docs tried the approach of running their huge apps business logic 100% in JS on mobile, and the performance and memory usage didn't meet expectations. If you try to do something like run formula recalculations on a 20,000 cell spreadsheet, on a low powered <em>Android</em> device, the performance is much worse than running the same code in Dalvik/ART.",
